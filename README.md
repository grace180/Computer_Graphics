## Basic Algorithm and DDA Calculator
This project is a simple web application that demonstrates the implementation of two popular algorithms for drawing lines in a coordinate plane: Basic Algorithm and DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer) Algorithm.
### Here are some example
1. (-5,5) and (1,2) using basic algorithm
